*fif* is a Stack-based Programming Language in Clojure. It is
intepreted, extensible, sandboxed, and simple. One major tradeoff in
the language is there is no parenthesis after invokation.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(require '[fif.core :as fif])

(fif/reval 1 1 +) ;; '(2)
#+END_SRC


* Introduction

  *fif* is meant to be a play on *forth*. The name forth was originally
  meant to be spelt *fourth*, but had to be reduced in order to fit
  within the restrictions of computers at the time of it's creation,
  and so the name stuck.
