* fif

  *fif* is a Stack-based Programming Language in Clojure. It is
  intepreted, extensible, safely sandboxed, and simple. The language
  has no parenthesis after invokation.

* Introduction

  *fif* is meant to be a play on *forth*. The name forth was originally
  meant to be spelt *fourth*, but had to be reduced in order to fit
  within the restrictions of computers at the time of it's creation,
  and so the name stuck.
